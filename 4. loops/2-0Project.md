### **Project: Number Guessing Game**

#### **Description**:
Create a game where the program:
1. Picks a random number between `1` and `100`.
2. Asks the user to guess the number.
3. Provides feedback:
   - `"Too high"` if the guess is greater than the number.
   - `"Too low"` if the guess is less than the number.
4. Ends when the user guesses correctly.

#### **Hints**:
- Use `Math.random()` to generate the number.
- Use a `while` or `do...while` loop to keep asking for guesses.
